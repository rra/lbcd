* It's not clear whether protocol v3 is worth it, and it's definitely
  unclear how service information is requested by the client and returned
  as part of the v3 support.  Better documentation is needed here, if v3
  ends up being worthwhile to keep.

* The reported load numbers can wrap around at high loads.

* The on_console code doesn't work properly on IRIX.

* More testing is needed to make sure that file descriptors are not leaked
  when doing service probes, that querying multiple services remotely
  works corectly, and that the daemon works when pounded on.

* Get -r -w load:incr to work in any order.
