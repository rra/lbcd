* It's not clear whether protocol v3 is worth it, and it's definitely
  unclear how service information is requested by the client and returned
  as part of the v3 support.  Better documentation is needed here, if v3
  ends up being worthwhile to keep.

* The reported load numbers can wrap around at high loads.

* The on_console code doesn't work properly on IRIX.

* More testing is needed to make sure that file descriptors are not leaked
  when doing service probes, that querying multiple services remotely
  works corectly, and that the daemon works when pounded on.

* Get -r -w load:incr to work in any order.

* Support the port argument for all of the protocol tests except HTTP
  (which already supports it).

* Add a test suite.

* General coding style cleanup: collapse header files together and use
  struct names rather than all-caps typedefs.

* Use the standard network library for bind and connect functions.

* Drop portability to systems without hsearch.

* Document the -t flag.

* Convert booleans to bool type.

* Delete the PID file on exit.

* Add a portability layer for utmp, and use getutxent by default if it's
  available.
