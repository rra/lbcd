                             lbcd To-Do List

lbcd:

 * Implement a new protocol that requires a secret key in order to
   return a reply in order to prevent lbcd from being used as a DoS
   attack reflector.  Provide command-line options to specify IP
   ranges that don't require the key and can use the old protocol.

Modules:

 * The reported load numbers can wrap around at high loads.

 * Support the port argument for all of the protocol tests except HTTP
   (which already supports it).

Portability:

 * The on_console code doesn't work properly on IRIX.

 * Drop portability to systems without hsearch.

 * Add a portability layer for utmp.

Code Cleanup:

 * Move the various standard modules out of the main code into the modules
   directory so that they're treated like all other modules.

 * Convert booleans to bool type.

 * Change all the uses of atoi to strtol with proper input checking.

 * Pass lbcd_service structs into the check modules instead of separate
   uint32_t pointers.

Test Suite:

 * More testing is needed to make sure that file descriptors are not
   leaked when doing service probes, that querying multiple services
   remotely works corectly, and that the daemon works when pounded on.

Documentation:

 * It's not clear whether protocol v3 is worth it, and it's definitely
   unclear how service information is requested by the client and returned
   as part of the v3 support.  Better documentation is needed here, if v3
   ends up being worthwhile to keep.
