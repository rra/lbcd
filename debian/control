Description: Return system load via UDP for remote load balancers
 lbcd is a daemon that answers UDP queries for system load information and
 returns such information as uptime, load, number of logged-in users,
 percentage free of /tmp and /var/tmp, and whether there is a user on the
 console.  It is intended for use with a load balancing system, and is
 particularly useful for such things as UNIX clusters for remote login
 where a traditional hardware load balancing solution doesn't work as well.
 .
 No load balancing system is included in this package, only the client
 daemon and a simple Perl script to query it.  No security or access
 control is done by the daemon, so access control must be done via
 iptables, a firewall, or an equivalent system.
