lbcd (3.4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Update the LDAP check to do something more reasonable.
    - Fix the HTTP check to correctly verify the server status, and allow
      any 20x or 30x status code as a success.  Previously, any status
      code response would have accidentally been considered a success.
    - Fix possible memory overwrite and security issue when run on a
      system with more than 512 unique logged-in users.
  * Rewrite the init script.
    - Use LSB functions for output and logging.
    - Add a status action.
    - Be more correct about the exit status.
    - Remove the PID file after stop.
    - Remove set -e to avoid spurious init script failures.
  * Remove old init script failure workaround.  We no longer need to worry
    about upgrades from old init scripts that failed if lbcd couldn't be
    stopped.  The old versions were never in Debian.
  * Use set -e in maintainer scripts.
  * Always create the lbcd user if missing, even on postinst maintainer
    script actions other than configure.
  * Improve comments in /etc/default/lbcd.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Switch to debhelper rule minimization.
    - Enable hardening flags.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} and ${perl:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream source, Debian tarball, and
    binary packages.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to rebuild the build system.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Mark lbcd as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Add Homepage, Vcs-Git, and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update Debian source package format to 3.0 (quilt).
  * Rewrite debian/copyright in copyright-format 1.0.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4.
