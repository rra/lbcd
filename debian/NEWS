lbcd (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Any -P option present in DAEMON_ARGS in /etc/default/lbcd should be
  removed.  Under systemd and upstart, there's no need for lbcd to write a
  PID file, so adding this flag is now handled by the init script.  If the
  option is not removed on upgrades, the daemon may fail to start, since
  the systemd and upstart configurations no longer create the directory
  for the PID file.

  The NO_START option in /etc/default/lbcd is no longer supported and will
  be converted to update-rc.d lbcd disable on upgrade.  To re-enable the
  lbcd service later, run update-rc.d lbcd enable.  upstart users will
  need to manually disable the service since the update-rc.d disable
  interface currently doesn't support upstart.

  lbcd no longer allows the client to ask for arbitrary supported service
  probes.  Instead, all services that a client may query must be
  explicitly allowed with -a command-line options (set in DAEMON_OPTS in
  /etc/default/lbcd).  This only applies to version three queries.
  lbnamed only uses version two queries and is not affected.
