lbcd (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  lbcd no longer allows the client to ask for arbitrary supported service
  probes.  Instead, all services that a client may query must be
  explicitly allowed with -a command-line options (set in DAEMON_ARGS in
  /etc/default/lbcd).  This only applies to version three queries.
  lbnamed only uses version two queries and is not affected.
