# This file is sourced by lbcd's startup configuration and is used to
# configure the behavior of the daemon.  This file must follow standard POSIX
# shell syntax.  For systemd compatibility, it should be restricted to simple
# variable assignments.

# Additional options to pass to lbcd.  This is the place to put -R, -c, -a, or
# any similar options that are needed.  Do not add -P here; it will be added
# as needed by the init script.
