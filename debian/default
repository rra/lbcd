# Defaults for the lbcd daemon.  -*- sh -*-

# This file is sourced by lbcd's startup configuration and is used to
# configure the behavior of the daemon.  This file must follow standard POSIX
# shell syntax.  For systemd compatibility, it should be restricted to simple
# variable assignments.

# Uncomment this line to not start lbcd at boot time.  Use of this option
# is supported for backward compatibility but is deprecated.  The best way
# to stop lbcd from starting at boot is "update-rc.d disable lbcd".
#NO_START=1

# Additional options to pass to lbcd.  This is the place to put -R, -c, or
# any similar options that are needed.  Do not add -P here; it will be
# added as needed by the init script.
