# This file is sourced by /etc/init.d/lbcd and is used to configure the
# behavior of the init script.  This file must follow standard POSIX shell
# syntax.

# Uncomment this line to not start lbcd at boot time.  Use of this option
# is supported for backward compatibility but is deprecated.  The best way
# to stop lbcd from starting at boot is "update-rc.d disable lbcd".
#NO_START=1

# Additional options to pass to lbcd.  This is the place to put -R, -c, or
# any similar options that are needed.  Keep the -P option so that the init
# script will continue working properly.
